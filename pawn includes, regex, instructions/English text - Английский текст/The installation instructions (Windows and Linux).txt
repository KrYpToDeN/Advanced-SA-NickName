Advanced-SA-NickName v5.0 - The installation instructions.

1. Put files ASAN.dll and ASAN.so into plugins folder;

5. After that it's necessary to recompile all your GameMode/FilterScripts;
6. Into include ASAN_FS.inc there are next hooks/natives for correctly plugin work. DO NOT CHANGE THEIR CONTENTS!
		6.1) native ASAN_HOOK_GetPlayerName(name[]);
		6.2) stock ASAN_INCLUDE_GetPlayerName(playerid, name[], length);
		6.3) stock ASAN_INCLUDE_SetPlayerName(playerid, name[]);
		
7. Include adds NATIVEs for using into Pawn (into your GameMode):
		7.1) native ASAN_IsValidNickName(name[])
			- Verifies the validity of the entered nickname, based on the settings in your 'ASAN_Config.ini';
			- Returns 'true;' in case of correctness of the entered nickname;

			- Returns the minimum length of the nickname, based on the settings in your 'ASAN_Config.ini';
			
		7.3) native ASAN_GetMaxNickLength()

8. The configuration file 'ASAN_Config.ini' will automatically appear in the 'scriptfiles' folder after the first start. It contains:
	It's necessary to restart the server after any editing of the settings file.

		Max_Players = 1000
			- Max players of your server. DON'T SET meaning less, than was setted in your server.cfg.
			- By default it's = 1000

		Language = 0
			- Plugin's log language. 0 - English, 1 - Russian

		EnableValidNickHOOK = 1
			- Enable symbols check hook - 1, Disable symbols check hook - 0

		RegexTemplate = ([а-яА-ЯёЁ0-9\[\]\_\$\=\(\)\@\.]+)|([a-zA-Z0-9\[\]\_\$\=\(\)\@\.]+)
			- Regex Template! Don't include nick's length!
			- Some Regex templates you can find in plugin's archive

		MaxAllowdedSpaces = 0
			- Number of replace the underscore symbols(_) to space symbols( ), By Default it's = 0
			- (-1 - no restrictions(all symbols will be replaced), 0 - disabled(By default))
			- Example. If 'MaxAllowdedSpaces = 1' -> 'John_Connor' will be in server side (In TAB menu) such as 'John Connor' after player connected.
			- Another underscore symbols will be missing (John_Connor_Jr will be John Connor_Jr)
			- Be careful while using this function with your DataBase!
			- DON'T USE SPACES INTO CLIENT SIDE (SA-MP CLIENT WINDOW)! ONLY SERVER SIDE!

		EnableNickLengthHOOK = 1
			- Enable nick length number hook - 1. Disable nick length number hook - 0.

		MinNickLength = 3
			- Minimum length of NickName. By default it's = 3

			- Two or more players can use same NickNames

		IgnoreRepeatedNicksCase = 1
			- When set to - 1, the case doesn't matter - nickname 'heLLo' is the same as 'Hello'. When - 0, they're not the same.
			- Example. If 'IgnoreRepeatedNicksCase = 1' you can use same NickName (Example. Alex and ALEX) in any case at the same time. If it's = 0, only one case can be used (who was connected first)
			- Attention! This function was tested only with Russian and English symbols! Nobody knows how it will work with another language!

		MaxRepeatedNicks = -1
			- The number of repeated nicknames (-1 - no restrictions, 0 - is the same, as 'EnableRepeatedNicksHOOK = 0')

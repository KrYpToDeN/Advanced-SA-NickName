# Advanced-SA-NickName v5.0 - The best NickName plugin. Version 5.0 will be released soon.
#### Advanced settings for your nickname:

1. You can use your own symbols in NickNames (set your rules by Regex templates).
2. You can use repeated nicknames (more than one same nicknames) on your server.
3. You can use nickname length, different from standart (1 - 24 symbols).
4. You can replace the underscore symbols (_) to space symbols ( ) before players connect.
5. You do not need to change memory addresses when upgrading to a new version of the SA: MP server. The plugin will do everything for you.
6. Any manipulations with plugin take place in the configuration file scriptfiles/ASAN_Config.ini (created at the first start).
7. There are lot's of extra functions for your nickname in the configuration file.
8. Разрешенные символы, а также правила их использование прописываются через Regular Expressions (Regex).
9. The plugin works and I hope it will work on any version of SA:MP, starting with SA: MP 0.3C R5.
10. There are some extra functions for your Pawn code to control NickNames.
11. A large request. Read the instructions that are provided in the archive.
12. No bugs detected at the moment!

The archive contains plugins for various OS, includes for Pawn code, installation instructions, Regex templates, and a log of changes.

#### For compilation:

1. On Windows OS use Visual Studio (The better version is >= 2017).
